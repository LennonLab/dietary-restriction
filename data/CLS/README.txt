1> Day175: Preliminary survivorship data
2> Day 275 DR: Survivorship assayed on DR. .xlsx files include some preliminary t-tests which may be of interest. Raw data are in .csv files. A python script was used to convert raw data into .csv files with proportional survivorship. Early values were corrected so that survivorship did not exceed 1. For example, if 212 CFUs were counted at T0 and 237 CFUs were counted at T2, then the value at T0 was manually set to 237. This accounts for the heterogeneity among populations in reaching maximum cell density at stationary phase.
3> Day 275 YPD: Same as DR folder but assayed on standard medium

4> Case format spreadsheets: Temporary unsummarized datasheets.

5> SPSS files were used to generate preliminary figues.

6> The Python script is the one referred to in the Day 275 DR paragraph.
