We measured growth yield of evolved and ancestor cultures. To do this, we measured i> the number of cells per mL in each culture via flow cytometry; ii> the amount of glucose remaining per mL in each culture via high-performance liquid chromatography.
	Recorded here are the HPLC data and the flow cytometry data. Ying-Chih Chuang lent generous help with the HPLC instrument. 
	We used the 7.5 hr incubation data
